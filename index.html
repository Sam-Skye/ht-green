                <h1>Towards a zero electricity bill</h1>

                <p>Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old bulbs with LEDs, got a new fridge and
                    super-efficient heat
                    pump and youre still paying around $1200 a year? Your next step is to let HT Green work with you to
                    design and install a
                    system that uses solar, wind or geothermal that's guaranteed to wipe that power bill for now and
                    into
                    the future.</p>

                <h2>Geothermal</h2>

                    alt="geothermal power plant surrounded by steam and large pipes in foreground" width="250"
                    height="250" class="float-right">

                <p>Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth is warmer than
                    the air and we can use this to heat your home. HT Green can engineer a solution
                    to fit your situation to give you free plentiful home warming energy year-round.</p>

                <p>Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly, but
                    has previously been geographically limited to areas near tectonic plate
                    boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the
                    range and size of viable resources, especially for direct applications such as
                    home heating.</p>

                <p>Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the
                    earth, but these emissions are much lower than those of conventional fossil fuels.
                    As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming
                    if widely deployed instead of fossil fuels.</p>

                <p>If you have the space and the aspect, we have the know-how to engineer a
                    wind turbine system that generates electricity when the wind blows. Team a
                    wind turbine with a solar PV system and you increase your energy generation
                    potential.</p>
                <p>New to wind power? HT Green can show you more about how a wind turbine
                    works, the benefits of wind energy and how a wind turbine is installed.</p>
                <p>If you're not sure on the type of turbine you need, before you buy from us,
                    contact one of our wind power experts for the right advice.</p>
